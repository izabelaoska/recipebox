## Hello 

This is a project built with Typescript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS and Daisy UI. 

Feel free to clone it and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 

Then run dev server with `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project. 

## The purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to translate Figma design and implement functionality where user can add recipe to view later. 
Saved recipe is visible in the side menu - please click on the bookmark icon on the right upper corner. 

Please play around with screen sizes (including mobile) and how reipe cards are presented - any feedback is welcome here. 
I took quite simple approach to show them all in a list for user to be able to browse. 

The side menu/drawer - it does appear from the right side. This is I think - for the purpose of this exercise more straight forward approach (I looked on Mob website too)

I hope you enjoy playing around with it! Let me know what you think.
